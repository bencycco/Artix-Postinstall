ALUMINIUM FOIL - Purification
To remove the oxide layer on the foil, place the stips into a bath of 0.0022% acetic acid.
Leave the stips throughout the next step.

FERROUS SULPHATE - Extraction
Dissolve Xg of the Plant food into XmL of water and heat to 90C.
Stir and filter the mixture while still boiling.
Collect filtrate and place in a salted ice bath until crystals form.
Weigh the yield.

MAIN REACTION - Substitution
3FeSO4 + 2Al -> 3Fe + Al2(SO4)3

Since neither the Ferrous Sulphate nor Aluminium are totally pure, the yield will be reduced.
Dissolve the Ferrous Sulphate in Room Temperature Distilled water.
Remove the Aluminium Strips from the Acetic Acid bath and add them to the solution. A black precipitate should form on the foil. Keep adding strips one at a time, making sure they are not exposed to air, until no precipitate is formed.
Filter the solution and weigh the yield. An ideal yield is observed when the iron is similar to that of the iron sulphate (in moles).

CLEAN UP
Dispose of easily
	The acetic acid bath
	Excess aluminium
	Low iron plant food
Keep as souvenir
