				<p>The Ydo market (pronounced /ɪdoʊ/) is a controlled market for selling safe and reliable help for drug users, such as Opiate safety, and Drug Purity.</p>
				<p>Vendors can ONLY sell the products listed on the left. If a Vendor wishes to sell another item, they should request it by sending an email to johndoe@johndoe.com. Note that we</p>
				<p>will not permit any requests of Hard Drugs such as Cocaine, Heroin, Methamphetamine, or any Benzodiazepines, because this market is designed to be safe.</p>
				<span id="FAQ">FAQs</span>
				<p id="FAQ">How are the drugs regulated?</p>
				<p>In truth, they aren't. We rely on you, the buyer, to discern whether or not a vendor is trustworthy based on their reviews. We also recommend that you test any and all drugs</p>
				<p>that you buy yourself for purity and adulterants.</p>
				<p id="FAQ">How does the buying process work?</p>
				<p>The customer transfers the correct amount of Monero to us, Ydo, and after the vendor confirms the package is sent, and the customer confirms that package as recieved, Ydo sends</p>
				<p>the vendor 98.1% of the monero (we take a 1.9% commission). This entire system ensures that nobody gets scammed, unless there is an exit scam but as the current Dread Pirate</p>
				<p>Roberts, I do not intend to do that.</p>
				<p id="FAQ">Why Monero over Bitcoin, or other cryptocurrencies?</p>
				<p>Monero is much harder to trace than Bitcoin, simple as that.</p>
				<p id="FAQ">How do I know my data will not be stolen?</p>
				<p>We use a system that means you and other users do not actually edit the site often. Every comment is sent through us to check it, as well as your personal details.</p>
				<p>This does raise other questions like "What if you steal my data", and to that I say, I won't, just trust me. Every request sent to us is deleted after it is seen, However</p>
				<p>If your request hasn't been seen in that time, it is saved until it is confirmed.</p>
				<p>For any further questions email johndoe@johndoe.com</p>
				<h1 id="thanks">-Thank you for choosing Ydo.</h1>
